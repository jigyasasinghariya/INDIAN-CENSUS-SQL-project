# INDIAN-CENSUS-SQL-project
**Project Title**: Exploratory Data Analysis of Indian Census

Why this topic  -  It's a big dataset, in this with less column we still can create multiple  & deep insights with limited data.

**Overview**:
This SQL portfolio project delves into the depths of Indian Census data, extracting valuable insights and trends to shed light on demographic patterns. Despite the dataset's limited scope, strategic use of SQL functions, statistical analysis, and insightful queries reveal compelling information about literacy rates, population growth, and regional variations.

**Key Features**:

1.Literacy Rate Analysis: Utilizing SQL functions, I've dissected the dataset to uncover literacy rates at both state and district levels. This analysis involves aggregating and comparing educational attainment across regions.

2.Population Dynamics: Through SQL queries, I've explored the growth rates of different states and districts over previous census periods. This includes statistical calculations to derive growth percentages and uncover population shifts.

3.Data Manipulation Techniques: Employing SQL functions such as TOP, BOTTOM, and LIMIT, I've efficiently filtered and organized the data. These techniques enhance the project's clarity and focus on key insights.

4.Historical Comparison: By leveraging SQL, I've performed time-based analyses, comparing population statistics from previous censuses. This reveals historical trends, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of demographic changes.

**Technical Highlights**:

1.Queries and Functions: The project showcases a variety of SQL queries, including aggregations, filtering, and statistical functions. This demonstrates a solid command of SQL for data extraction and manipulation.

**Conclusion**:
This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in SQL, showcasing the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from limited datasets. The exploration of Indian Census data provides valuable insights into demographic trends, laying the foundation for more extensive analyses in the future.
